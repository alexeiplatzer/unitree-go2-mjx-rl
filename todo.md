# Todo list

## By Section

### Package
- [X] make the vision environment use a simplified setup
- [ ] improve the non-vision teacher student env and test it
- [ ] add column or box like obstacles, so that navigation provides a greater advantage.
- [ ] add pure tracking and forward moving cumulative reward to metrics, no normalizations.
- [ ] add student supervised convergence to progress tracking
- [ ] refactor evaluation to happen on the side of the fitter with callbacks.
- [ ] add more robust checkpointing to the training
- [ ] make a continuous version of the stripes tiles (zig-zag)

### Notebooks
- [ ] update the yaml config files and default config values
- [ ] try to get the vision setup to work on kaggle, perhaps with limitation to just 1 device.
- [ ] configure a curriculum training kaggle pipeline with terrain
- [ ] add nice post-training rendering and results-saving
- [ ] update the universal notebook, try to add curriculum training there perhaps
- [ ] organize and minimize all the different notebooks on github, kaggle and colab

### Documentation
- [ ] update the historical todo changelog
- [X] organize the todo section
- [ ] update the notion workspace
- [ ] update the readme
- [ ] add docstrings everywhere

###  Presentation
- [ ] finish logically organizing the google slide presentation for monday
- [ ] integrate graphs and videos of the notebook results in the presentation.
- [ ] create a picture of the architecture with drawio
- [ ] format everything nicely
- [ ] add references to papers in the overview section

### Experiments guide

- [ ] find the optimization saturation with the simplest setup
- [ ] check if more complicated setups offer improvement
- [ ] check if complicated setups still beat at lower training steps
