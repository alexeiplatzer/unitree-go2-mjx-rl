## Todo list

- [ ] define appropriate cameras in mjcf
- [ ] visualise cameras output
- [ ] add vision support to notebook
- [ ] add teacher observations to vision environments
- [ ] try training full setup
- [ ] try training partial setups
- [ ] add training checkpoints
- [ ] add evaluation metrics and saving results
- [ ] update the notion workspace and mb presentations
- [ ] replicate experimental results
- [ ] try to keep madrona built on kaggle

### Experiments guide

- [ ] find the optimization saturation with the simplest setup
- [ ] check if more complicated setups offer improvement
- [ ] check if complicated setups still beat at lower training steps
